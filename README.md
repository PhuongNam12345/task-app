# Gin-gonic framework

## Getting started

Prerequisites
Go: any one of the three latest major releases (we test it with these).

### Getting Gin

-With Go module support, simply add the following import
import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

to your code, and then go [build|run|test] will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies.
Otherwise, run the following Go command to install the gin package:
$ go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
